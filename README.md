Our paper, **Cloud Object Detector Adaptation by Integrating Different Source Knowledge**, has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

We follow the trend of the times and explore an interesting and promising problem, **Cloud Object Detector Adaptation (CODA)**, where the target domain leverages detections provided by a large vision-language cloud detector to build a target detector.

Code will be available soon!
