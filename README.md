Our paper, **Cloud Object Detector Adaptation by Integrating Different Source Knowledge (COIN)**, has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

We follow the trend of the times and explore an interesting and promising problem, **Cloud Object Detector Adaptation (CODA)**, where the target domain leverages detections provided by a large vision-language cloud detector to build a target detector.

*Please note that CODA does not restrict whether CLIP is used, even though CLIP is used in our method COIN.*

Code will be available soon!
